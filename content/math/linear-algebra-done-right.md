During the study of linear algebra, several asistant materials are
referenced:

1.  The opencourse 18.06 from [Gilbert Strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/). From Strang's home, many
    valuable materials are available.
2.  The textbook _Introduction to Linear Algebra_ by Gilbert Strang.
3.  The textbook _Linear Algebra Done Right_ by [Sheldon Axler](http://www.axler.net/). You can
    get an abridged version of _Linear Algebra Done Right_ from Axler's
    homepage.
4.  The textbook _Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra_ by [Carl D. Meyer](http://meyer.math.ncsu.edu/).

By following Professor Strang, I got an overview of the four spaces of
one matrix. Actually, I learnt the 18.06 from the MIT OCW more than
one time. After each time, my understanding of linear algebra was
deepened.
