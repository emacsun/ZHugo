## <span class="section-num">1</span> introduction {#introduction}

Using [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) I divide my Org config into servel private layers for
the sake of easy maintenance and flexibility. You can check my
[.spacemacs.d](https://github.com/emacsun/.spacemacs.d) on github. I suggest you excerpt some of my config
instead of copying all of them because some of them maybe not what you
want.

Based on the comprehensive tutorial [Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html),
I build my own GTD system using Org. Actually, there exists quite a
few posts on building personal GTD system through Emacs Org. Some
excellent ones are listed as below:

1.  [Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html) . This article is the starting
    point of my serious using of Emacs Org as GTD tool. It is quite
    long, but deserves spending time to read it. It pays off.
    Furthermore, reading just one time is not enough. Perhaps you
    will visit this post several times before your GTD system is
    handy.
2.  [Using org-mode as a Day Planner](http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/) . This article describe how the
    author replace pen-and-paper day planner with the Emacs Org.
    After trying many software available, the author choose Emacs
    Org.
3.  [How I use Emacs and Org-mode to implement GTD](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/gtd_workflow.html) . The author's job
    is developing classroom training materials and E-Learning
    solutions for a software company based in North Sydney. It's
    also worthwhile to give the article a shot.

I am not interested in listing all the articles. What I want to say
is that you need to define your need first. After that you can
excerpt the config from other's implement. Most of the time you
will modify other's config before Org is handy for you. So some
knowledge of Elisp is desirable.


## <span class="section-num">2</span> My GTD workflow {#my-gtd-workflow}



First let me introduce my GTD workflow. In general, a task in my GTD
workflow will go the road shown as below whick is the same as show in
[Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html) but with different triggering
conditions:

<a id="orgca2c240"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/tools/20180210myworkflow.png" caption="state transitions for a task in my workflow" width="400" >}}

The main features are listed below.

1.  Every moment, for the sake of clearing my head, I capture all the
    ideas or some todos jumping into my head during my handling one
    event. I will handle the capture later.
2.  Every morning, I check the my agenda which is generated by a
    combination of ten commends.
3.  I check the scheduled tasks and the tasks which is near the
    deadline.
4.  After the scheduled one and the deadlined one, I take a `NEXT`
    task, which is in `NEXT` status. Also, I start a clock under such
    task.
5.  After finished the `NEXT` tasks, the `NEXT` status will be changed
    to `DONE` automatically. Then I pick a new task in the `TODO` lists
    and change the `TODO` status into `NEXT`. Everytime I change a
    `TODO`  task into a `NEXT` task, clock is running under that task
    automatically.
6.  After finished all the `TODO` tasks, I check the `DONE` list to see
    if there is any tasks need to be archived.


## <span class="section-num">3</span> some preparations {#some-preparations}



In order to run the GTD, some preparations are needed.


### <span class="section-num">3.1</span> set the agenda file {#set-the-agenda-file}



To use Org as a GTD tool, the first thing is to setup the
`org-agenda-files` ;

```lisp
;;set up the agenda files
(setq org-agenda-files (list "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zlife.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zwork.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zdiary.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/ztimelog.org"))
```

As you can see, I put my configs into the Dropbox directory, so that
my config will never lose even if I delete them from the local
carelessly.

Notice that there is a file named "zrefile.org" which is the entrance
of all my todos and some other captures. It plays as an inbox.
Everytime I check this file and take actions to clean it. All this can
be done in the agenda buffer, which I will explain later. To refile
the items in the refile.org, I need to set up the refile targets.


### <span class="section-num">3.2</span> set the refile targets {#set-the-refile-targets}



```lisp
(setq org-refile-targets (quote (
          ("~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zwork.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zlife.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/math.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/computer.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/telecommunication.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/life.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/tools.org" :maxlevel . 6))))
```

Notice that, besides the zwork.org and zlife.org which are the agenda
files, there are other five org files. These five org files are for my
personal blog. Sometime, I capture a draft or outline of a new post in
the zrefile.org, so I need to refile these drafts into the right
category.

To understand why I add these extra five org files as the refile
targets, you need to see my `org-capture-templates`


### <span class="section-num">3.3</span> set the org capture templates {#set-the-org-capture-templates}



```lisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(
        ("t" "todo" entry (file "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org")
         "* TODO %? :TODO: \n Added:%T\n"
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("h" "Hugo post")
        ("hm" "Math"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/math.org" "Math")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         ":math:"
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hc" "Computer"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/computer.org" "Computer")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("ht" "Telecommunication"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/telecommunication.org" "Telecommunication")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hl" "Life"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/life.org" "Life")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("ho" "Tools"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/tools.org" "Tools")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hm" "movie"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/all-posts.org" "Movie")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hl" "life"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/all-posts.org" "Life")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
         ("l" "my Log Time" entry (file+datetree "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/ztimelog.org" ) "** %T - %?  :timelog:" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("d" "diary" entry (file+datetree "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zdiary.org" ) "* %t - %?  :diary:" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("x" "org-protocol" entry (file "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org")
         "* TODO Review %c \n Added:%T\n")
        ))
```

I have a template for `zrefile.org` which is :

```lisp
("t" "todo" entry (file "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org")
 "* TODO %? :TODO: \n Added:%T\n"
 :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
```

To understand the meaning of this template, you need to read the doc
for variable `org-capture-templates`.

whenever I check the org-agenda, I will see a block contains all the
need-to-refile tasks. So you may curious about my set of
`org-agenda-custom-commands`


### <span class="section-num">3.4</span> set the org agenda custom commands {#set-the-org-agenda-custom-commands}



```lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        (quote (
                (" " "Agenda"
                 ((agenda "" )
                  (tags "NOTES"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "NOTES to Refile")
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil)))
                  (tags "REFILE"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Tasks to Refile")
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil)))
                  (tags-todo "-CANCELLED/!"
                             ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Stuck Projects")
                              (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-non-stuck-projects)
                              (org-agenda-sorting-strategy
                               '(priority-down category-keep))))
                  (tags-todo "-HOLD-CANCELLED/!"
                             ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects")
                              (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-non-projects)
                              (org-agenda-sorting-strategy
                               '(priority-down category-keep))))
                  (tags-todo "-CANCELLED/!NEXT"
                             ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Project NEXT Tasks")
                              (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-projects-and-habits-and-single-tasks)
                              (org-tags-match-list-sublevels t)
                              (org-agenda-sorting-strategy
                               '(priority-down todo-state-down effort-up category-keep))))
                  (todo "TODO"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Project Subtasks TODO")
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels t)))
                  (todo "DONE"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Project Subtasks DONE")
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels t)))
                  ;;;;(tags-todo "-CANCELLED+WAITING+HOLD/!"
                  (todo "HOLD"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Waiting and Postponed Tasks")
                         (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-stuck-projects)
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil)
                         (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'future)
                         (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'future)))
                  (tags "-REFILE/"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Tasks to Archive")
                         (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-non-archivable-tasks)
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil))))
                 nil))))
```

You should never copy the above snippet, because there are some
functions whose definitions are not contained in the snippet.
Actually, you should go to my Github page to get the repository if you
are interested in my .spacemacs.d

According to the command, one of the sample of my org agenda may look
like:

<a id="org4310c5b"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/tools/20180210orgagenda.png" caption="my org agenda sample" width="900" >}}

I have three projects: math,computer and communication
(telecommunication). For each projects, there are some tasks. All the
projects appear as level-1 headlines in the org file and the tasks
appear as sub-level headlines. If all the tasks under one project are
in `TODO` state, the project is stuck. If at least one of the task
under one project is in `NEXT` state, the project is running.

I think the structure of my agenda buffer is straightforward. you can
define your own `org-agenda-custom-commands` by reading the manual and
[this post](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.html).
