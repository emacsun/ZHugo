## introduction {#introduction}

Using [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) I divide my Org config into servel private layers for
the sake of easy maintenance and flexibility. You can check my
[.spacemacs.d](https://github.com/emacsun/.spacemacs.d) on github. I suggest you excerpt some of my config
instead of copying all of them because some of them maybe not what you
want.

Based on the comprehensive tutorial [Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html),
I build my own GTD system using Org. Actually, there exists quite a
few posts on building personal GTD system through Emacs Org. Some
excellent ones are listed as below:

1.  [Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html) . This article is the starting
    point of my serious using of Emacs Org as GTD tool. It is quite
    long, but deserves spending time to read it. It pays off.
    Furthermore, reading just one time is not enough. Perhaps you
    will visit this post several times before your GTD system is
    handy.
2.  [Using org-mode as a Day Planner](http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/) . This article describe how the
    author replace pen-and-paper day planner with the Emacs Org.
    After trying many software available, the author choose Emacs
    Org.
3.  [How I use Emacs and Org-mode to implement GTD](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/gtd_workflow.html) . The author's job
    is developing classroom training materials and E-Learning
    solutions for a software company based in North Sydney. It's
    also worthwhile to give the article a shot.

 I am not going to list all the articles, even some popular articles
 are missed. What I want to say is that you need to define your need
 first. After that you can excerpt the config from other's
 implement. Most of the time you will modify other's config before
 Org is handy for you. So some knowledge of Elisp is desirable.
