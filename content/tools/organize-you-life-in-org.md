## <span class="section-num">1</span> introduction {#introduction}

Using [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) I divide my Org config into servel private layers for
the sake of easy maintenance and flexibility. You can check my
[.spacemacs.d](https://github.com/emacsun/.spacemacs.d) on github. I suggest you excerpt some of my config
instead of copying all of them because some of them maybe not what you
want.

Based on the comprehensive tutorial [Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html),
I build my own GTD system using Org. Actually, there exists quite a
few posts on building personal GTD system through Emacs Org. Some
excellent ones are listed as below:

1.  [Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html) . This article is the starting
    point of my serious using of Emacs Org as GTD tool. It is quite
    long, but deserves spending time to read it. It pays off.
    Furthermore, reading just one time is not enough. Perhaps you
    will visit this post several times before your GTD system is
    handy.
2.  [Using org-mode as a Day Planner](http://newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/) . This article describe how the
    author replace pen-and-paper day planner with the Emacs Org.
    After trying many software available, the author choose Emacs
    Org.
3.  [How I use Emacs and Org-mode to implement GTD](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/gtd_workflow.html) . The author's job
    is developing classroom training materials and E-Learning
    solutions for a software company based in North Sydney. It's
    also worthwhile to give the article a shot.

I am not interested in listing all the articles. What I want to say
is that you need to define your need first. After that you can
excerpt the config from other's implement. Most of the time you
will modify other's config before Org is handy for you. So some
knowledge of Elisp is desirable.


## <span class="section-num">2</span> My GTD workflow {#my-gtd-workflow}



First let me introduce my GTD workflow. In general, a task in my GTD
workflow will go the road shown as below whick is the same as show in
[Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html) but with different triggering
conditions:

<a id="org60a044f"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/tools/20180210myworkflow.png" caption="state transitions for a task in my workflow" width="400" >}}

The main features are listed below.

1.  Every moment, for the sake of clearing my head, I capture all the
    ideas or some todos jumping into my head during my handling one
    event. I will handle the capture later.
2.  Every morning, I check the my agenda which is generated by a
    combination of ten commends.
3.  I check the scheduled tasks and the tasks which is near the
    deadline.
4.  After the scheduled one and the deadlined one, I take a `NEXT`
    task, which is in `NEXT` status. Also, I start a clock under such
    task.
5.  After finishing the `NEXT` tasks, the `NEXT` status will be changed
    to `DONE` automatically. Then I pick a new task in the `TODO` lists
    and change the `TODO` status into `NEXT`. Everytime I change a
    `TODO`  task into a `NEXT` task, clock is running under that task
    automatically.
6.  After finishing all the `TODO` tasks, I check the `DONE` list to see
    if there is any tasks need to be archived.


## <span class="section-num">3</span> some preparations {#some-preparations}



In order to run the GTD, some preparations are needed.


### <span class="section-num">3.1</span> set the agenda file {#set-the-agenda-file}



To use Org as a GTD tool, the first thing is to setup the
`org-agenda-files` ;

```lisp
;;set up the agenda files
(setq org-agenda-files (list "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zlife.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zwork.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zdiary.org"
                             "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/ztimelog.org"))
```

As you can see, I put my configs into the Dropbox directory, so that
my config will never lose even if I delete them from the local
carelessly.

Notice that there is a file named "zrefile.org" which is the entrance
of all my todos and some other captures. It plays as an inbox.
Everytime I check this file and take actions to clean it. All this can
be done in the agenda buffer, which I will explain later. To refile
the items in the refile.org, I need to set up the refile targets.


### <span class="section-num">3.2</span> set the refile targets {#set-the-refile-targets}



```lisp
(setq org-refile-targets (quote (
          ("~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zwork.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zlife.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/math.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/computer.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/telecommunication.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/life.org" :maxlevel . 6)
          ("~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/tools.org" :maxlevel . 6))))
```

Notice that, besides the zwork.org and zlife.org which are the agenda
files, there are other five org files. These five org files are for my
personal blog. Sometime, I capture a draft or outline of a new post in
the zrefile.org, so I need to refile these drafts into the right
category.

To understand why I add these extra five org files as the refile
targets, you need to see my `org-capture-templates`


### <span class="section-num">3.3</span> set the org capture templates {#set-the-org-capture-templates}



```lisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(
        ("t" "todo" entry (file "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org")
         "* TODO %? :TODO: \n Added:%T\n"
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("h" "Hugo post")
        ("hm" "Math"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/math.org" "Math")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         ":math:"
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hc" "Computer"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/computer.org" "Computer")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("ht" "Telecommunication"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/telecommunication.org" "Telecommunication")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hl" "Life"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/life.org" "Life")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("ho" "Tools"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/tools.org" "Tools")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hm" "movie"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/all-posts.org" "Movie")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("hl" "life"
         entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/all-posts.org" "Life")
         (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
         :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
         ("l" "my Log Time" entry (file+datetree "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/ztimelog.org" ) "** %T - %?  :timelog:" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("d" "diary" entry (file+datetree "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zdiary.org" ) "* %t - %?  :diary:" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
        ("x" "org-protocol" entry (file "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org")
         "* TODO Review %c \n Added:%T\n")
        ))
```

I have a template for `zrefile.org` which is :

```lisp
("t" "todo" entry (file "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org")
 "* TODO %? :TODO: \n Added:%T\n"
 :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
```

To understand the meaning of this template, you need to read the doc
for variable `org-capture-templates`.

whenever I check the org-agenda, I will see a block contains all the
need-to-refile tasks. So you may curious about my set of
`org-agenda-custom-commands`


### <span class="section-num">3.4</span> set the org agenda custom commands {#set-the-org-agenda-custom-commands}



```lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        (quote (
                (" " "Agenda"
                 ((agenda "" )
                  (tags "NOTES"

                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil)))
                  (tags "REFILE"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Tasks to Refile")
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil)))
                  (tags-todo "-CANCELLED/!"
                             ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Stuck Projects")

                              (org-agenda-sorting-strategy
                               '(priority-down category-keep))))
                  (tags-todo "-HOLD-CANCELLED/!"

                              (org-agenda-sorting-strategy
                               '(priority-down category-keep))))
                  (tags-todo "-CANCELLED/!NEXT"
                             ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Project NEXT Tasks")
                              (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-projects-and-habits-and-single-tasks)
                              (org-tags-match-list-sublevels t)
                              (org-agenda-sorting-strategy
                               '(priority-down todo-state-down effort-up category-keep))))
                  (todo "TODO"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Project Subtasks TODO")
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels t)))
                  (todo "DONE"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Project Subtasks DONE")
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels t)))
                  ;;;;(tags-todo "-CANCELLED+WAITING+HOLD/!"
                  (todo "HOLD"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Waiting and Postponed Tasks")
                         (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-stuck-projects)
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil)
                         (org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled 'future)
                         (org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines 'future)))
                  (tags "-REFILE/"
                        ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Tasks to Archive")
                         (org-agenda-skip-function 'bh/skip-non-archivable-tasks)
                         (org-tags-match-list-sublevels nil))))
                 nil))))
```

You should never copy the above snippet, because there are some
functions whose definitions are not contained in the snippet.
Actually, you should go to my Github page to get the repository if you
are interested in my .spacemacs.d

According to the command, one of the sample of my org agenda may look
like:

<a id="orgce6e879"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/tools/20180210orgagenda.png" caption="my org agenda sample" width="900" >}}

I have three projects: math,computer and communication
(telecommunication). For each projects, there are some tasks. All the
projects appear as level-1 headlines in the org file and the tasks
appear as sub-level headlines. If all the tasks under one project are
in `TODO` state, the project is stuck. If at least one of the task
under one project is in `NEXT` state, the project is running.

I think the structure of my agenda buffer is straightforward. you can
define your own `org-agenda-custom-commands` by reading the manual and
[this post](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.html).


## <span class="section-num">4</span> One day based on my workflow {#one-day-based-on-my-workflow}




### <span class="section-num">4.1</span> Punch In {#punch-in}



At the beginning of every day, I use `F8 I` to punch in, which starts
a clock under a task called Organization:

```lisp
(defvar bh/organization-task-id "eb155a82-92b2-4f25-a3c6-0304591af2f9")
```


### <span class="section-num">4.2</span> check out the agenda {#check-out-the-agenda}



Check out the agenda, using `org-agenda` which is bound to `SPC a o o
SPC` or `SPC o a SPC` or `F5 SPC` . Because the `org-agenda` buffer
will be visited quite a few times, I bind this command to several
shortcuts. Using the customed command `SPC` , I collect all the
projects,  tasks with `TODO` and `NEXT` states in the project which
give me an overview of what should be done next and what should be
started next.

<a id="org44a51bf"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/tools/20180210orgagenda2.png" caption="my org agenda overview" width="900" >}}

As we can see from the screenshot, the agenda of today is listed at
the beginning with scheduled task and deadline task.

Following today's agenda, several blocks are displayed with each
headline in green color and large font size. Those blocks shows:

1.  **Notes to Refile**, which is the draft of a post which should be
    refile to math.org computer.org or telecommunication.org.
2.  **Tasks to Refile**, which is the Ideas or tasks hitting my head
    during handling one tasks. I store these tasks in zrefile.org then
    process them later after finishing current tasks.
3.  **Stuck Projects**, which are the projects have no sub-tasks in
    `NEXT` state.
4.  **Projects**, which are the projects have at least one sub-tasks in
    `NEXT` state.
5.  **Project Next Tasks**, which are `NEXT` sub-tasks in all Projects.
    In particular, you can filter out the `NEXT` tasks belonging to
    certain project.
6.  **Project Subtasks TODO**, which are all the `TODO` sub-tasks
    belonging to all projects.
7.  **Project Subtasks DONE**, which are all the `DONE` sub-tasks
    belonging to all projects.
8.  **Waiting and Postponed Tasks**, which are all the tasks in `WAITING`
    and `HOLD` state.
9.  **Tasks to Archive**, which are the tasks being tagged as `DONE` for
    a period and need to be archived.


### <span class="section-num">4.3</span> focus on certain project {#focus-on-certain-project}



If you have many `TODO` tasks, it is desirable to focus on certain
project at one time. Just move the cursor on the Project you want to
focus, then press `^` . If you want to focus on another project, press
`^` again then select another project, press `^`.

<a id="org0626b05"></a>
{{< figure src="/img/tools/20180210orgagenda3.png" caption="focus on certain project" width="900" >}}

Actually, there are quite a few commands helping you coin your own
view of the agenda buffer. some handy are listed below:

<a id="org22a9818"></a>

<div class="table-caption">
  <span class="table-number">Table 1:</span>
  some handy agenda commands
</div>

| shortcuts | command                           | description                                                                                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`       | org-agenda-filter-by-tag          | Filter the agenda view with respect to a tag                                                             |
| `<`       | org-agenda-filter-by-category     | Filter the current agenda view with respect to the category of the item at point                         |
| `^`       | org-agenda-filter-by-top-headline | Filter the current agenda view and only display the siblings and the parent headline of the one at point |
| `=`       | org-agenda-filter-by-regexp       | Filter the agenda view by a regular expression                                                           |
| `_`       | org-agenda-filter-by-effort       | filter the agenda view with respect to effort estimates                                                  |

You can find more agenda commands by reading `Agenda views` part of
the Org manual which is built in the Emacs.


### <span class="section-num">4.4</span> change the state of one task {#change-the-state-of-one-task}



It is quite easy to change the state of one task. By default, the
state is in `TODO` state. After start clocking the task, the task will
be in `NEXT` state automatically.

From `NEXT` to other state, you just use `C-c C-t` . If you are in the
org agenda buffer, press `t` one the line of the task.

Once the task is set as `DONE` , a temporary buffer will jump out and
let you take some note to record the task.


### <span class="section-num">4.5</span> using the mobile phone to take capture {#using-the-mobile-phone-to-take-capture}



In general, there are two app one is `Org-mobile` and the another one
is `BeOrg`. I prefer to the later because of is easy to use. All you
have to do is put your agenda files in a Dropbox directory.

`Org-mobile` is kind of complex, and need to config both on the phone
and the PC. I finally make it run on both my iPhone and Surface pro 4.
However, I resort to `BeOrg` because you will never forget how to use
`BeOrg` . Unfortunately, I forget how to use `Org-mobile` after I did
not use it for a month.


## <span class="section-num">5</span> conclusion {#conclusion}



My GTD workflow based on Org is summarized. To be honest, I change my
workflow quite often. So the configuration will change subsequently
which is the source of joy using Emacs. You can always config it as
handy as possible.
