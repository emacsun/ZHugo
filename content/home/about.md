# Biography
After spending more than ten years to be a communication engineer, I am armed with solid math foundation for information theory, channel coding theory and wireless communication system. From the very beginning being a serious software eigineer has always been on my dream list. Fortunately, computer science has so much in common with the information theory, which lends me a hand to transform from a communication engineer to a software engineer. No matter in which field, I would love to devote my life to be a beauty-creator with the spirit of craftman in the digital world.

My interests includes (not all):

1. information theory

2. channel coding theory

3. artificial intelligence

4. natural language processing
