# Biography
A serious software engineer with wide interests. Spending more than ten years to be a communication engineer, I am armed with solid math foundation for information theory, channel coding theory and wireless communication system. Also, computer science which has so much in common with the fields mentioned before always attract me. I would love devote my life to be a beauty-creator with the spirit of craftman in the digital world.
